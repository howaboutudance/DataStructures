1.4) Write a program that reads in a file and outputs the file as modified by the inlcude statements.

As of writing this I was succesfully able to open 3 files, read 2, find a certain phrase and print both to terminal. I was able to succesfully print the #include I made to it's called location in the other file! What I was not able to do was write to a file. I am currently trying this.

Side note, the more programming I do, the more documentation pages I read, the easier it is to read them and the more of them I can read. May seem small but to me is a big deal. I used to abhor reading those because I was constantly reminded of how miniscule my learning is. But I feel a little more confident now... just a little.

1.5) Write a recursive function that returns the number of 1 in the binary representation of N. 
	
	EXAMPLES

Enter an integer: 
4
There are 1 binary 1's
------------------
Enter an integer: 
456
There are 4 binary 1's
------------------

1.7) Prove the following formulas:
	a) logX < X for all X > 0
		1) Base condition: log1 < 1 (log1 = 0)
	b)  Blog(A)	= log(A^B)
		let A = X^r so log(base-x)(A) = r
				= log(base-x)((X^r)^B)
				[log(base-x)(X^r) = r
				= rB
				= log(base-x)(A)*B
				= Blog(A)

1.12) 	n
	a)	∑  (2i - 1) = n² 
	   i=1
		base case)
		i = 1 (2∙1 - 1) = 1²
					  1 = 1

	   n+1
		∑ (2i - 1) = 
	   i=1

	    n
	   (∑ [2i - 1]) + 2(n + 1) - 1 =
	   i=1

		n² + 2n + 1 = 
		
		(n + 1)²


	b)	
		

[1.15]) write a main that creates an array of rectangles and finds the largest rectangle. First in area then in perimeter.

	I did it! below is some of my print out: 

	1812 is the biggest perimeter
	19448 is the biggest area
