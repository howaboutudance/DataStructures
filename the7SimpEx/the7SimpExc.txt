6 (7) easy exercizes.

1, 2, 3 and 6, 4, 5, 7

1)
	Below is the print out from my minMaxAverage.cpp file after compiled:

	Enter first integer: 3
	Enter second integer: 4
	Enter last integer: 3
	The average is: 3.33
	The smallest is: 3
	The largest is: 4

2) 
	Below is the printout from my TestIntCell.cpp file which uses the TestInt.cpp and TestInt.h after compilation:
	
	Cell contents: 5 and 8
	Cells added: 13
	New Cat cell :3 : 12
	Added 53 to cat : 65
	Minused 53 to cat : 12
	Adding 2 IntCells together: 13

3 and 6)
	First I set an array of IntCells with the values (0 - 5) And I set an IntCell array of pointers.

	Then through a pointer to the reference of an array I set each pointer to each IntCell in an array.
	Then I print out what's in the array by derefrencing the pointer:
		0  
		1
		2
		3
		4
		5

	Then to test I did this right (I did this wrong SO MANY TIMES ...) I updated one original IntCell with 82828. Then I printed it out using a dereferenced pointer.
		82828

	Then I used a derferenced pointer to change the space of another IntCell and printed it using the original array:
		2843

	Then I printed out an array spot using a friend:
		1	

4) 
	Below is an example of how a shallow copy affects your program. If I change the value to my pointer cell then the original cell gets changed too! Oh noes!

	Setting arr1[0] = 42
	Read arr1[0]: 42
	Now lets change only arr2[0] = 43 
	Read arr1[0]: 43		

5) I didn't understand what 5 was asking for and I was sick so I stayed home Friday :/

7)
	Setting m1 and m2
	m1: 4 , m2: 6

	having m1 = m2
	m1 = m2

	Now printing out the result
	m1: 6 , m2: 6
	
	Does m1 == m2?
	m1 == m2 // yes it does!

	I made them different again. m1: 6 m2: 3

	Does m1 now not equal m2?
	m1 != m2 // yes it doesn't...?!

	Is m2 less than m1?
	m2 < m1 // why yes it is!

	Could I please print using << overload and a friend?
