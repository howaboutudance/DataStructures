each spot needs to know if it is a pathway or edge or end

for int i 
    for int j
        if j is 0 or (j.length - 1)
            make edge
        if i is 0
            make edge
        elif i is (i.length - 1)
            make end
        else
            make 0 (false)


while not end
    random direction
    while random direction is edge
        choose another random direction
    make spot pathway
